# Proxy
Custom proxy development for HTTP requests

# How to run
This proxy was written in python so you can use any python3 version to run the following command and utilize the proxy.

```
python3 proxy.py <port> <image-flag> <attack-flag>
```
with this command you can run the proxy.py file and have the proxy apply to any http requests as long as the port specfied is the same as the port being sent on from Firefox.
